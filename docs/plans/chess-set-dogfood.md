# Chess set dogfood: what is left

The set is designed and every program is generated
([generators/chess](../../generators/chess/README.md); `run_all.sh PORT`
rebuilds all of it from nothing into `scratch/chess/`, every setup verifying
clean, the board engraved a-h and 1-8). What remains is the machine. What the
round taught about the development loop is [dev-loop.md](dev-loop.md).

## 0. At the machine (the user)

1. **The rotary as installed.** Jog A +90 and watch which way a mark on the
   chuck's top moves; read the axis letter and steps/degree from Mach3's
   motor tuning; measure the chuck's diameter, its grip, the chuck-to-centre
   length, and the real rapid feed. They go into `MACHINE` in
   `generators/chess/cam.py`. Until then no rotary program is for the machine.
2. **The pawn blank in cheap wood**, rough and finish only (`-T1`, `-T2`);
   calipers on the first pawn against the drawing.

The pawn blank has no rest pass: its profile is finishable by the 3 mm ball.

## Verification

At the machine: calipers on the first pawn against the drawing.
