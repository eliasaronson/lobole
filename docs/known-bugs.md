_No confirmed unfixed defects._

The orbit-lag + stale-silhouette pair in the outline renderer was fixed by
the [rendering/outline-perf.md](rendering/outline-perf.md) work (precomputed
edge adjacency, per-frame-in-flight edge buffers, settle-pass policy),
covered by `tests/test_outline_edges.cpp`.

The preview-handle miss regression was fixed in `PreviewHandles.cpp` and is
covered by the `fillet_body_edge_via_click` GUI test.
